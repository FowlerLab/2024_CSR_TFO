# Analysis and figures for Hull, et al., Deep Mutational Scan of a DNA Polymerase via Compartmentalized Self-Replication

Requirements:
R 4.0.0 or greater

## Purpose
This repository houses all of the analysis and figures for the Multiplexed Assay of Variant Effect (MAVE) in this paper called Compartmentalized Self-Replication Deep Mutational Scanning (CSR-DMS). It includes an R script that takes processed sequencing data from both short- and long-read sequencing and calculates functional scores for nearly all missense, nonsense, synonymous, and single amino acid deletions in our designed TFO polymerase. It also contains scripts that were used remotely to process our raw Illumina and PacBio sequencing data. Figure panels and analysis products are available in the outputs folder.
